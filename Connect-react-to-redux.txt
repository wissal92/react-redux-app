*******************
REACT-REDUX LIBRARY
*******************
=> TIES OUR REACT COMPONENTS TOGETHER TO REDUX. IT CONSISTS OF TWO CORE ITEMS:

1) THE PROVIDER COMPONENT => attaches app to store and its is utilized in our app route
by wrapping our entire app. This is how the provider component attaches our app to 
the redux store.

ex: <PROVIDER store={ourStore}>
      <App/>
    </Provider>

2)CONNECT FUNCTION => wraps our component so it's connected to the redux store.

ex: export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(OurComponent);


******************
USEFUL TIPS
*****************
+ EVERY TIME THE COMPONENT IS UPDATED, THE mapStateToProps FUNCTIONS IS CALLED.
SO IF WE ARE DOING SOMETHING EXPENSIVE IT IS BETTER TO USE A LIBRARY LIKE RESELECT
FOR MEMOIZING.
